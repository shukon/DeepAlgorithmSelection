DLAS aims to be a framework for experiments on Algorithm Selection, mainly using Deep Neural Networks.
DLAS is based on the Algorithm Selection Library (ASlib, https://github.com/coseal/aslib_data).

The framework is under heavy construction and may not be working correctly at all times, backwards-compatibility is not guaranteed. To perform experiments, define the options in an experiment in dlas/config/experiments.
More specific instructions will follow soon.
